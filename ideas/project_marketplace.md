# Project Market Place

This would involve and open source market place designed to attract businesses that 
are frustrated with needlessly complicated business tools. Tools they feel lack a
common sense approach to their everyday problems. They end up spending huge amounts of
money for support.  The business modal ends up being extremely skewed to favor leaving 
out features in order to charge for them later.

In this system companies could present their business problems and any individual
or team could propose a plan to solve the problem.  Everything would always be out
in the open so that no mistep in communication or logic would be left unseen.

The system could be gamified for all parties so that it felt like a community.
