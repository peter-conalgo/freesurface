# The Free Surface polictial party

Global Libertarian living fueled by the idea that humans don't need so many rules to progress.

I have mentioned the [danger](https://github.com/freesurface/freesurface/issues/18) that our current system poses to people.

If you put labels on people and give them no real hope for anything other than to identify with a group you get bad government.
It is only destined to become more and more irrational.  The controlling human interest is no longer focused on the goal of a
free spirit. This will not get better until we try to fix it.  Power is a great desire, it strokes the ego like no other thing
on earth.  The thing is, as an objective minded person I need to try to prevent further erosion in this sense.

There is a global genenerational shift occuring right now.  I am doing my very best to seise the opportunity to shift objectionable mindsets.

### Politics of today is focused on an outdated view of capitalism

We need capitalisim >2000

We need the original motitvations back. We need to know there is a way and want to make it real. Capitalism took off
because it focused on personal liberties more than anything had before.  It inspired people who were escaping opression.
It was worth dying for to many people. 

People 100 years ago didn't think, "I sure hope everything ends up being full of endless bureaucracy".

Here is a list of my made assumptions about what the critical mass did not think 100 years ago:

- "I sure hope everything ends up being full of endless bureaucracy"
- "I am totally cool if a few companies become indivduals with a mindless goal of thinking the same thing over and over again, and have the right to own everything should they choose to."

# Would I run for government?

Hell no! Well I guess if it meant that my main job was to make sure that this direction was secured.  I think we do need to remove indivduals from situations of power where they could impact anothers pursuit of hapiness.
