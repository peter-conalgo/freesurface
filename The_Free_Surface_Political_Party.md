# The Free Surface polictial party

Global Libertarian living fueled by the idea that humans don't need so many rules to progress.

I have mentioned the [danger](https://github.com/freesurface/freesurface/issues/18) that our current system poses to people.

If you put labels on people and give them no real hope for anything other than to identify with a group you get bad government.
It is only destined to become more and more irrational.  The controlling human interest is no longer focused on the goal of a
free spirit. This will not get better until we try to fix it.  Power is a great desire, it strokes the ego like no other thing
on earth.  The thing is, as an objective minded person I need to try to prevent further erosion in this sense.

There is a global genenerational shift occuring right now.  I am doing my very best to seise the opportunity to shift objectionable mindsets.

People need to give a fuck and build a future that means something to us.
