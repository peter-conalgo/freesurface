## Current state of official hypothesis

If culture at large adpoted the beneficial philosophies of open source, progress would 
accelerate in technology and human well being.

### What is open source?

Today open source means a lot of things to a small group of passionate people. They would do anything 
to make the day real where it just no longer made sense to keep ideas closed up behind walls. All of these
people know that it amounts to awareness and showing its usefulness. They try very hard to form communities
and shape some of the most amazing things you could ever imagine - should you imagine that way.

The reality is that most of us don't, we know what the world is from where we sit. The truth is that
no one person can know what the critical mass really wants.  We need to find a way to make the critical
mass tell us what what open source needs to mean. We need to know what people really want from it,
what would really make them take action to have it.

This project is a way for the world to just plain and simple say, MAKE THIS FOR US!

By getting new curious folks to take part in it directly through the world's largest open source platform
we may be able to get a few more perspectives wandering around here.  There are a lot of professionals out
there who could easily pick up a few new habbits to take part in it all.

### The idea

The idea is simple. Patents must end. A new economy begins.  Very crazy we understand. Just asking people 
to really think hard about what value those concepts bring to them anymore.

### What is up with the name?

It is meant to be a metaphor when relating to the actual meaning of the event, and another methpor when 
just looking at the words. In physics a free surface is the act of a liquid forming a level 
surface. It's the idea that as knowledge is gained it spreads to form the free surface. This
is in direct contrast to the act of trying to turn every idea into a comodity before it has 
even truly proved that it has real value. People can navaigate throughtout information and  go where their 
curisosity takes them. When hearing just the words it can create a positive tone towards open 
source and sharing in general.

### What are the plans for Free Surface?

Well the idea would be to kick of projects in a strategic way so that projects with an 
agreeable opportunity for success are started with.  The first projects would be 
geared towards finding tools or lack of tools that if replaced with an open 
initiative could better those people and in effect, that industry.  The first major step is
to go through the process of creating a non profit and researching how to get
a charitable status.  The next step is to find a business or industry that would 
like to invest in an initiative that targets their talent and their best interests. The
business wins because they get a chance at more inovation and a more satisfied workforce.

### We need Scientists and Economists!

At this point, everything written here is a giant brain dump by a single human being.  That
will change over time.  One things that we notice is that the Science community could play
a bigger role in open source.  The same thing goes for Economists.

If you are in a lab using any tool or software that cost 8 million dollars for no good reason,
that just does not seem right.  Github is such a great resource for collaboration, and it is
excellent from a design perspective (very important). We would like to welcome scientists
and economists to participate in open source with us!

### We need Lawyers!

It seems that the best course of action for free surface is to register as a non-profit in
Canada.  We need legal help to accomplish this so that we can figure out if their is a 
way to provide taxable benfits to compaines who embrace this methodology.

> Legal fees can be donated at Indiegogo [here](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-surface-non-profit-registration-legal-work/x/6349072?show_todos=true).

### We need Psychologists!

The word satisfaction gets used quite a lot right now in this document and a rough
guess around how that all ties together.  We need psychologists to help us understand
what really is the best way for a person to be productive.  What are the real
important states of mind.  Should we find a way for more people to work from home
and focus on thier families?

### We need investment

If you are company that thinks they would like to pinoneer in an area like this, let us 
know!

### We need publicity

This is all well in good, but it is still just a spec among specs right now.  There is
no valid case to say that what is written here right now if effective enough to
get someone involved.  If anyone has any ideas about how to get more participation 
in this, please make an issue or contact us.

### What sort of industries could this work in?

As of right now, it's just a big fat guess, so we are saying ALL. I hear of a lot of
presidents of million dollar range companies complaining about how software seems to 
get more expensive over time and less useful. Companies like Oracle spend more time
acquiring new arms than they do perfecting the business software they offer.

### How can I help?
Start making github issues with what ever ideas your brain can come up with.  There is a lot
of indivdual bias in this current text. It could also be distilled down quite a bit. One
good plan is to fork this repo and send back pull requests. You can also go a bit further and 
create a markdown file with your [idea](ideas).

Ideally we get some people who write code, to start engineering [something](ideas/freesurface.md) that lets people
add their ideas in an intuitive way and with algorithms that maintain solid democracy. 
At the same time it would also need to promote optimistic ideas that line up to whatever 
objective there may be at the time. A little bit of work to do there, but something like 
[reddit](http://reddit.com) is a pretty good model for it.

Head over to [pullup](http://pullup.herokuapp.com/) to see the process of an app forming from
nothing in action right now!

### What if I have no idea how to do anything but read this, and I want to do more??

Hmmmmmm... that is a very good hypothetical made up question. As mentioned above you could 
make an issue, but that means that you need a github account.  If you just want to email
us, you do so at info@freesurface.org.

### How do I learn how to code if I never had before?

We would say that anyone can write code, they just need to be fond of logical thought.  There
is also a way of thinking that is important to get in the habit of before you start 
trying to write a line of code. It's all based around the concepts of binary and ternary logic. 
The thing is that you don't need to understand what that means, you just have to do things that 
form your ability to see problems under that sort of pretence.

We would suggest a wonderful experiment that was created at [MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/)
called [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/). Beware, this is for children so keep it in a non shared 
state and let the kids have their own community and time to create an unbiased future for us. It is
all designed to help kids explore these concepts and turn them into things.  It's like digital lego
more or less. We always hear of people moving to new countries and learning new languages through
children's literature.  Same idea!

Shared Scratch projects include the source files to allow other 'kids' to download and extend, and we encourage you to do just this, but be mindful to avoid using profanity when naming objects in case you feel compelled to share back.

### Does Free Surface have anything on the go?

Yup, it's called [StackStrap](https://github.com/freesurface/stackstrap). It's for developers
in small teams who build projects frequently and need a good way to tie best practices into
their workflow. Always looking for anyone at all to try it out and see if the philosophy can
hold up at their workplace. Needless to say, contributions are welcome.

### Credits

Credits should not be looked as something that is required to point the original brain child. It's
more of a tool for you to track down the original evolution of the idea or maybe you could say meme.
Context helps a lot, and you can learn a lot if you follow  how a tool found it's way to it's 
current state.

The idea for this approach to the project was inspired by [pullup](https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup).
It's just a baby, so jump on board and get your ideas in.  Tracing back a little more, that idea was
rooted from a cool Node.js boilerplate called [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter).
It's a great way to get a bunch of hackers running at the same time to get their ideas out all at once.
Currenlty at Free Surface we are really into projects that help everyone get off their feet with code
and in the right direction. So thanks to folks who find satisfaction in those things.
