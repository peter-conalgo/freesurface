# What is the idea?

People born between  the 70s - 90s have been brought into a world where too many of our brightest feel disenfranchised and struggle to see a future for themselves.  People born between the 40s - 60s are from a time where anyone who worked hard could find their way into a commodity that they could capitalize on. It's the thing that could universally provide satisfaction to anyone looking realize their potential.

Today every commodity on earth is spoken for by a small number of corporations and every logical thought has a patent against it.  How do we reasonably expect the current system to provide opportunity to future generations.  More over, what really is opportunity?  What are people really seeking?  Looking at all the different states of mind, the one we chase the most is the sense of satisfaction.

Look back to people born between the 10s - 30s.  They built their own homes, made their own clothes, baked their own bread, solved so many little problems each and every day.  They were very humble at large and were ready and willing to give their lives when the world wars took hold.  They wanted to preserve the world that they felt had so much more potential, and it did.

The thing is, the next generation started to fixate on one single form of satisfaction.  The satisfaction of financial success.  This form of satisfaction was readily available to any hard working person for a long time.  It grew and evolved, law after law was created with this single objective in mind.  Entire industries have been created with the sole purpose of advancing this cause. 

There is really only one industry today where young ambitious people can chase satisfaction and find it only when they work hard and love what they do.  It is the world of the internet and technology.  Any other industry is filled with young people that struggle to swallow the card they were dealt and navigate through the layers of corporate bureaucracy.

It is to the point where companies like Zynga games make billions of dollars making simple games that solely tie into a persons need to feel incremental moments of satisfaction.  People actually head home for the day and spend hours pretending to be able to influence the betterment of something.  This simply can not continue.

The internet and it's core philosophies are what the future of society depends on.  Open source endeavours are a gold mine of opportunity for incremental moments of satisfaction.  The problem is that right now it is geared to people who have a deep passion and understanding of technology.  We need to make open source a practical opportunity for everyone.  Anyone with a concept or insight should know there is common place to turn to and have an opportunity for real influence.  It all starts with the workplace, the place where everyone comes in at 9 and leave at 5, and maybe accomplished 2 things of real true worth.  

The tech industry is dominated by open source software, and it makes complete sense as to why.  If you think of something at your job that helps someone, and they think of something at their job that help you, you trade!  All the biggest and baddest open source projects are tools that people use to make the things that they really want to make.  Anyone lately who tries to capitalize on a tools like these will likely soon after be out shadowed by an alternative open source project.  The bottom line is that people just want to create and solve.  New economies are forming where open source is the source of the jobs. This is simply because people realize that it's not the legal rights to the code that matters, it's the fact that people care about the project.

This very phenomenon needs to be applied to all the other industries  where smart people are feeling very little sense of self satisfaction.  We need to find a way to insert open source projects into other industries, get developers interested in outside projects, and get people interested in converting their time and ideas into real things.

Unfortunately the current controlling generation have very little life experience to see the true value of this.  They see the idea of not making proprietary rights your first objective as misguided.  After a lifetime in an economy where your objective is to turn any possible thing you can into money, it makes sense.  

Patents need to go away and the government needs to step back and let the new generation use the momentum of these movements to create and shape the future.  If an advancement is made, it should be available to benefit any other initiative, and it should happen at the speed of light.  Progress should rise much like the oceans, creating a free surface where all can continue to find satisfaction and a real feeling of self worth.

### What is up with the name?

It is meant to be a metaphor when relating to the actual meaning of the event, and another methpor when 
just looking at the words. In physics a free surface is the act of a liquid forming a level 
surface. It's the idea that as knowledge is gained it spreads to form the free surface. 
People can navaigate throughtout and just go where their curisosity takes them. When hearing
just the words it can create a positive tone towards open source and sharing in general.

### What are the plans for Free Surface?

Well the idea would be to kick of projects in a strategic way so that projects with an 
agreeable opportunity for success are started with.  The first projects would be 
geared towards finding tools or lack of tools that if replaced with an open 
initiative could better those people and in effect, that industry.  The first major step is
to go through the process of creating a non profit and researching how to get
a charitable status.  The next step is to find a business or industry that would 
like to invest in an initiative that targets their talent and their best interests. The
business wins because they get a chance at more inovation and a more satisfied workforce.

### How can I help?
Start making github issues with what ever ideas your brain can come up with.  There is a lot
of indivdual bias in this current text. It could also be distilled down quite a bit. One
good plan is to fork this repo and send back pull requests. You can also go a bit further and 
create a markdown file with your [idea](ideas).

Ideally we get some people who write code, to start engineering [something](ideas/freesurface.md) that lets people
add their ideas in an intuitive way and with algorithms that maintain solid democracy. 
At the same time it would also need to promote optimistic ideas that line up to whatever 
objective there may be at the time. A little bit of work to do there, but something like 
[reddit](http://reddit.com) is a pretty good model for it.

Head over to [pullup](http://pullup.herokuapp.com/) to see something like this in action 
right now!

### What if I have no idea how to do anything but read this, and I want to do more??

Hmmmmmm... that is a very good hypothetical made up question. As mentioned above you could 
make an issue, but that means that you need a github account.  If you just want to email
us, you do so at info@freesurface.org.

### How do I learn how to code if I never had before?

We would say that anyone can write code, they just need to be fond of logical thought.  There
is also a way of thinking that is important to get in the habit of before you start 
trying to write a line of code. It's all based around the concepts of binary and ternary logic. 
The thing is that you don't need to understand what that means, you just have to do things that 
form your ability to see problems under that sort of pretence.

We would suggest a wonderful experiment that was created at [MIT Media Lab](http://www.media.mit.edu/)
called [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/). Beware, this is for children so keep it in a non shared 
state and let the kids have their own community and time to create an unbiased future for us. It is
all designed to help kids explore these concepts and turn them into things.  It's like digital lego
more or less. We always hear of people moving to new countries and learning new languages through
children's literature.  Same idea!

Shared Scratch projects include the source files to allow other 'kids' to download and extend, and we encourage you to do just this, but be mindful to avoid using profanity when naming objects in case you feel compelled to share back.

### Does Free Surface have anything on the go?

Yup, it's called [StackStrap](https://github.com/freesurface/stackstrap). It's for developers
in small teams who build projects frequently and need a good way to tie best practices into
their workflow. Always looking for anyone at all to try it out and see if the philosophy can
hold up at their workplace. Needless to say, contributions are welcome.

### Credits

Credits should not be looked as something that is required to point the original brain child. It's
more of a tool for you to track down the original evolution of the idea or maybe you could say meme.
Context helps a lot, and you can learn a lot if you follow  how a tool found it's way to it's 
current state.

The idea for this approach to the project was inspired by [pullup](https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup).
It's just a baby, so jump on board and get your ideas in.  Tracing back a little more, that idea was
rooted from a cool Node.js boilerplate called [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter).
It's a great way to get a bunch of hackers running at the same time to get their ideas out all at once.
Currenlty at Free Surface we are really into projects that help everyone get off their feet with code
and in the right direction. So thanks to folks who find satisfaction in those things.
